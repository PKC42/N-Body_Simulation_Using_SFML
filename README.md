# N-Body_Simulation_Using_SFML

Simulation of celestial bodies given velocities in the x and y direction along with acceleration in the x and y directions respectively. The mass and location of each
celestial body is also given. There are two classes: a CelestialBody class and a Universe class. The Unvierse class inherits members from CelestialBody to allow for information
to be easily accessed. The celestial bodies are drawn and displayed using SFML.
